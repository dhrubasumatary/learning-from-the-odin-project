    <p>That's lame.</p>
    <p>Maybe I should give you <em>a name</em>. But that's  <strong>a slippery slope.</strong> </p>
    
    <p>You're only in my head. We have to remember that.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <strong>What is it about society that disappoints you so much?</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Oh, i don't know.</strong>
        <ul>
            <li> Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, when when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?</li>
            <li> Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit. the world itself's just a big hoax. Spamming with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.</li>
            <li> Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. </li>
            <li>We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books make us happy but because <strong> <em>We wanna be sedated</em>.</strong></li>   
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Because it's painful not to pretend, because we're cowards. F society.</strong></p>
