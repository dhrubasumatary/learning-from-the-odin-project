Basics of web , how internet works.
This repo is a record of my interaction while practising The Odin Project.  
The content here may not be structurally organised as it's solely based for my own comfort to understand the technologies I go along to learn throughout the whole interaction with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. 
Thank you for checking out.
